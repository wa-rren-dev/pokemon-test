# Pokemon Lineage Engine

## How to run

1. [Install Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) for your computer
2. Once installed, open your terminal and confirm that Node is available on the command line with `node -v`
3. From the root of the package, install the necessary dependencies with `npm install`
4. To run tests using Jest, run `npm run test`
5. To run on the command line, use `npm start` - you should be prompted to enter the name of a Pokemon, e.g. "charmander"
6. The returned result should be an object of the creature's lineage
7. You may be able to tell from my language that I don't know _anything_ about Pokemon.

**_NOTE!_** The tests run against the live Pokemon API
